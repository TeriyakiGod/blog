Hello, LinkedIn community! 👋 I'm thrilled to kick off my journey as a 3rd-year computer engineering student with a deep fascination for embedded development. 🚀

My journey into the world of embedded systems began during my studies at the University of Technology Koszalin, where I delved into microprocessors and electronics. 📚 This fascination was further enriched when I took part in an Embedded Automotive Internship at GlobalLogic. 💼

I've always had a profound love for video games 🎮 and have even dabbled in developing a few for fun on my own.

My goal 🎯 is clear: to work with embedded systems and become a professional in this field.

My dream is to land a job at one of the pinball machine companies, where I can blend my passion for embedded development and gaming into a fulfilling profession.

I'm excited to document my career progress and share my achievements along the way. Stay tuned for regular updates as I embark on this path toward becoming a professional embedded developer! 🧑🏼‍💻 #EmbeddedDevelopment #CareerGoals #VideoGames #EmbeddedElectronics
