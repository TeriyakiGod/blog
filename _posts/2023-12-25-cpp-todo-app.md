Embarking on the journey of crafting a Todo app API using a combination of C++, httplib, JSON, and SQLite has been an enriching experience. This blog post delves into the details of the project, highlighting the integration of these technologies and emphasizing the importance of best practices.

## Technologies Used

1. **C++:** The foundation of the project, ensuring high performance and efficiency.
2. **httplib:** A lightweight C++ HTTP library facilitating the handling of HTTP requests and responses.
3. **JSON:** Utilized for structured data representation, enhancing communication between the client and the API.
4. **SQLite:** A reliable and embedded database, simplifying data storage and retrieval within the application.

## Project Structure

The Todo app API's structure adheres to best practices, emphasizing modularity and scalability. The integration of JSON and SQLite contributes to the overall robustness and functionality of the application.

### User Roles

The 'user' and 'admin' roles provide flexibility in managing user permissions, enhancing the app's versatility.

### Authentication and Authorization

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) continue to play a crucial role in securing user authentication and authorization. The seamless integration of JSON ensures standardized data interchange.

### Database Management with SQLite

The adoption of SQLite simplifies data management, offering a reliable and embedded database solution. This choice ensures data integrity while maintaining a lightweight footprint.

## Pros and Cons of Using C++ for API Development

### Pros

1. **Performance:** C++ ensures optimal performance, crucial for handling API requests efficiently.
2. **Resource Management:** Manual memory management in C++ provides precise control, minimizing potential memory issues.
3. **Stability:** The compiled nature of C++ contributes to the stability and reliability of the application.

### Cons

1. **Learning Curve:** C++ may have a steeper learning curve compared to some other languages.
2. **Development Speed:** Writing code in C++ can be more time-consuming due to its strict syntax.

## Conclusion

The integration of C++, httplib, JSON, and SQLite in building the Todo app API has resulted in a powerful and well-rounded solution. While C++ may pose challenges in terms of a learning curve, the benefits in performance and resource management, coupled with the advantages brought by JSON and SQLite, make it a formidable choice for API development.

This project underscores the importance of selecting technologies that complement each other, leading to a cohesive and efficient application. As we navigate the ever-evolving landscape of web development, embracing a diverse set of technologies ensures adaptability and resilience in the face of evolving requirements.
